Anxiety itself can have a significant effect on the developing baby, on the newborn child and the mother-infant bonding process. We will use a combination of pregnancy blood tests and an ultrasound assessment to check on placental function, since placental damage is the greatest cause of poor outcome. Most women tested this way will have normal results, and so may feel reassured and do better in pregnancy than untested women. The benefits may extend after birth to mother-infant bonding, breastfeeding success and a reduced risk of postnatal depression. We will randomly select an equal number of women for testing and no testing (like tossing a coin, known as a randomized control trial) to be confident that any benefits observed are genuine. The potential benefits of our research would be substantial for the mental health of many pregnant women, for their newborn and for their children as they grow up. The tests are easy to do and would add very little in terms of a woman's and in terms of the total costs of prenatal care.",

                "brief_summary": "COVID-19 pandemic has developed worldwide in less than 4 months. While most patients have a mild or uncomplicated disease (80%), approximately 15% need hospital care and 5% intensive care. Severe cases are characterized by pulmonary involvement which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Early identification of patients who are likely to get worse is therefore a major issue.~While, chest X-ray has poor diagnostic performances, pulmonary computed tomography (CT scan) seems very sensitive (97%) and quite specific of COVID-19. Sub-pleural bilateral ground-glass pattern can precede the positivity of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. CT scan is now considered as the best imaging test to assess COVID-19 patients and is recommended as first-line diagnosis tool by the French Society of Radiology (SFR). However, performing CT scan in all or many patients with suspected COVID-19 may result in radiology department overload, especially, taking into account bio-cleaning between patients. Moreover, CT scan may lead to adverse effects including induced cancer due to the cumulative diagnostic irradiation.~Chest ultrasonography may be an alternative to CT scan. It is a simple, non-invasive, non-irradiating, inexpensive and available at the point of care (POCUS). Most of emergency physicians and many other specialists (pneumologists, infectious disease or intensive care physicians) are trained to perform chest POCUS and use it in their everyday practice. Multiple studies have demonstrated its superiority to chest X-ray for the detection of pneumonia. In ARDS, a scoring has been developed and has shown good correlation with mortality. POCUS is very effective in detecting peripheral patterns and seems appropriate to explore COVID-19 patients.~Previous studies suggest its interest in SARSCov2 infections for initial patient assessment and identification of lung damage. However, its performances have never been scientifically evaluated to date.~Our main hypothesis is that point of care lung ultrasonography performed during the initial examination may identify high-risk COVID-19 patients.",

                "brief_summary": "This study will explore the range and type of medical and developmental problems in patients with Muenke syndrome, a condition that results when one or more of the suture between the bones of the skull close before birth. Because of the premature closure, the skull is not able to grow in its natural shape; instead, it compensates with growth in areas of the skull where the sutures have not yet closed. This can result in an abnormally shaped head, wide-set eyes, and flattened cheekbones. Patients may also have an enlarged head, abnormalities of the hands or feet, and hearing loss.~The fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene, which is involved in the development and maintenance of bone tissue, plays a role in Muenke syndrome. In some cases, the FGFR3 mutation is inherited from a parent with Muenke syndrome; in other cases, where there is no family history of the disorder, the mutation occurs anew. A better understanding of this gene may lead researchers to develop better treatments and genetic counseling for people affected by Muenke syndrome.~Patients with Muenke syndrome and their blood relatives may be eligible for this study. Family members with confirmed Muenke syndrome will have genetic counseling, and patients undergo the following tests and procedures:~Review of medical records and test results.~Questionnaires about the patient's prenatal, birth, newborn, and past medical history; family history; growth and development; medications; and current therapies.~Physical, neurological, ear, nose and throat, dental, and eye examinations.~Neuropsychological testing to assess cognitive thinking abilities.~Hearing evaluation. This includes an audiology test in which the patients listens to soft tones through earphones; a power reflectance test in which a chirping sound is heard through an earpiece placed at the entrance to the ear canal, and possibly an ABR/ASSR test, in which electrodes are attached to the forehead, earlobes, and behind the ears to measure brain waves in response to certain conditions.~MRI scan of the brain. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed pictures of the brain. During the scan, the patient lies on a table in a narrow cylinder (the scanner), wearing ear plugs to muffle loud noises that occur with electrical switching of the magnetic fields.~MRI scan of the middle and inner ear. This test is similar to the MRI, but uses a dye injected in a vein to enhance the images.~CT scan of the skull. CT uses x-rays to produce 3-dimensional images of the part of the body studied.~Dental evaluation with x-rays.~Skeletal survey (x-rays of all bones of the body).~Developmental assessment of IQ testing.~Blood tests for research purposes. A cell line may be established for use in future research.~Medical photographs to demonstrate clinical features, including side and front views of the face, head, and other parts of the body that may be involved in Muenke syndrome, like the hands and feet.~Other consultations or tests as clinically indicated",

There are still no reliable methods to identify patients with pCR before radical surgery. As a result, clinical complete response (cCR), defined as no clinical detectable tumor by physical examination, endoscopic evaluation, and imaging, is designed as a surrogate endpoint for pCR. However, the concordance between cCR and pCR varies from 22% to 96% in different reports, which questions the clinical value of such strategies. Therefore, based on rectal diginal examination, serum CEA, MRI, endoscopy examination, we suggested to add multi-points and full-thickness biopsy technique to further improve the accuracy of cCR.",

This is called infertility. This results in significant distress and anxiety. Infertility is common; however, the investigators have no markers to predict who will be infertile. For couples diagnosed with infertility, the investigators have used blood and urine hormone levels (follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), inhibin B, and antimullerian hormone (AMH)) to tell us who will get pregnant with fertility treatment. The investigators don't know if these hormone levels can predict if regular people trying to get pregnant will be able to get pregnant. This study will try to determine if these hormone levels can predict fertility and infertility.",

Urate crystal deposition is responsible for acute and recurrent inflammatory flares which can be treated with colchicine, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), corticosteroid or interleukin (IL)-1b blockade. Colchicine and NSAID are contra-indicated in patients with chronic renal disease (CKD) stage 4/5 or with renal transplantation. In these patients gout flare is treated with high dose of corticosteroid or IL-1b inhibitors.~Frequent use of high dose of corticosteroid can worsen gout comorbidities including mellitus diabetes type 2, hypertension, obesity and dyslipidemia. Anakinra, an IL-1b receptor antagonist, is efficient in gout flare in patients without CKD stage 4/5.~The aim of this study is to demonstrate that anakinra is superior to prednisone to treat gout flare in patients with CKD 4/5 or renal transplantation.",

Microbiological cultures are currently regarded as the reference for identification of pathogenic bacteria. However, the sensitivity of these cultures is very variable and depends both on the context in which clinical samples are taken, and on the pathogen involved. The rate of detection varies according to infection type: from 50 to 70% for infectious spondylodiscitis, 65 to 95% for prosthetic joint infections, 50% for gonococcal arthritis and 90% for non-gonococcal arthritis. The aim of the study is to evaluate the diagnostic performances of microbiological cultures and molecular methods in case of osteoarticular infections. The gold standard will be established by an expert group of osteoarticular infection (composed by a bacteriologist, a radiologist, a surgeon, an anatomy-pathologist and a rheumatologist), which established the final diagnosis of infected or not infected patients.",
