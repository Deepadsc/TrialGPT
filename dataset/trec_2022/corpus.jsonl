{"_id": "NCT02671188", "title": "A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Mode of Action and Clinical Efficacy of GSK3050002 in Subjects With Psoriatic Arthritis", "text": "Summary: Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20 (CCL20) is a protein involved in attracting immune cells including subsets of T cells (for example Th17 cells), B cells, natural killer cells and dendritic cells to inflamed tissues in conditions such as psoriasis (Ps) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). CCL20 acts by binding and activating the chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) present on the surface of the inflammatory cells. Levels of CCL20 are increased in inflamed tissues in psoriasis (Ps) and inflammatory arthritis. GSK3050002 is a humanized Immunoglobulin G (Ig)G monoclonal antibody, which binds to and neutralizes the action of human CCL20. The hypothesis is that GSK3050002 will reduce the movement of inflammatory cells into tissues affected by Ps or PsA, thereby leading to an improvement in disease activity. The primary objective of this multi-centre, randomized, double-blind (sponsor open), placebo-controlled trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeat doses of GSK3050002, and to understand the mechanism of action (by taking skin and synovial biopsy samples) and potential for clinical efficacy of GSK3050002 in subjects with PsA. A minimum of 18 subjects and up to a maximum of 30 subjects will be randomised into the study to either GSK3050002 or placebo in a 2:1 ratio to ensure that approximately 18 evaluable subjects complete the study. The total duration of participation in the study will be approximately 21 weeks from screening to last study visit.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: \n\n Age>=18 years and <=75 years of age at the time of consent. \n\n Diagnosis of, and currently active psoriatic arthritis with >=3 tender and >=3 swollen joints, one of which must be either a knee or ankle joint suitable for synovial biopsies. \n\n C-reactive protein (CRP) >=3mg/l at the time of screening, thought by the investigator to be due to active PsA. \n\n A negative test result for Rheumatoid Factor at screening. \n\n Active PsA despite an adequate course of treatment with at least one of the following Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDS): methotrexate, sulfasalazine or leflunomide for a minimum of 3 months, with a stable dose prior to screening.

GSK3050002 is a humanized Immunoglobulin G (Ig)G monoclonal antibody, which binds to and neutralizes the action of human CCL20. The hypothesis is that GSK3050002 will reduce the movement of inflammatory cells into tissues affected by Ps or PsA, thereby leading to an improvement in disease activity. The primary objective of this multi-centre, randomized, double-blind (sponsor open), placebo-controlled trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeat doses of GSK3050002, and to understand the mechanism of action (by taking skin and synovial biopsy samples) and potential for clinical efficacy of GSK3050002 in subjects with PsA. A minimum of 18 subjects and up to a maximum of 30 subjects will be randomised into the study to either GSK3050002 or placebo in a 2:1 ratio to ensure that approximately 18 evaluable subjects complete the study. The total duration of participation in the study will be approximately 21 weeks from screening to last study visit."}}

However, more than 65 percent of individuals who are prescribed hypnotics use them for more than a year, and over 30 percent remain on these agents for more than five years. Whereas some patients may appreciate partial or full relief of insomnia symptoms with ongoing hypnotic use, continuous long-term use of these agents may not represent optimal therapy. Many insomnia patients who participate in non drug insomnia therapy such as as cognitive behavioral insomnia therapy or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy For Insomnia (CBTI) achieve sustained insomnia remission lon after a time limited course of treatment. However it is difficult for most long term hypnotic users to convert to a self management approach. Intervention that combine CBTI with a supervised medication tapering (SMT) have shown the greatest promise for achieving this outcome, but almost 50 percent of patients who receive this treatment either fail to discontinue hypnotics or resume them over time. Previous research provides only rudimentary understanding of how to help long term hypnotic users discontinue their sleep aids and successfully manage their insomnia with CBTI techniques.

{"_id": "NCT03596736", "title": "Elbow Hemiarthroplasty Versus Total Elbow Arthroplasty for Irreparable Distal Humeral Fractures", "text": "Summary: Distal humeral fractures can be difficult to treat, in particular when the joint surface is affected (intra-articular fractures). If rigid internal fixation with plates and screws can be obtained it is considered to be the treatment of choice. In elderly patients, poor bone quality (osteopenia) and fragmentation of the articular surface can make rigid internal fixation non-reliable or even impossible.

{"_id": "NCT02223975", "title": "Evaluation of the Role of Vibrational Spectroscopy in the Assessment of Vulval Disease", "text": "Summary: Can vibrational spectroscopy be used to accurately assess vulval skin conditions? Vulval skin disorders are common and the diagnosis of these conditions can be difficult. Reliable discrimination between benign vulval skin conditions, precancerous conditions or vulval cancer often requires tissue biopsies. In addition the monitoring of patients with vulval disease at risk cancerous change is currently limited to visual assessment often supplemented by multiple invasive tissue biopsies. There are currently no established non invasive tests available for the diagnosis of vulval skin diseases.~The vibrational spectroscopic techniques of Raman spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy are non invasive diagnostic tools that use the interaction of light within tissues to identify the chemical composition of different tissues.

Vulval skin disorders are common and the diagnosis of these conditions can be difficult. Reliable discrimination between benign vulval skin conditions, precancerous conditions or vulval cancer often requires tissue biopsies. In addition the monitoring of patients with vulval disease at risk cancerous change is currently limited to visual assessment often supplemented by multiple invasive tissue biopsies. There are currently no established non invasive tests available for the diagnosis of vulval skin diseases.~The vibrational spectroscopic techniques of Raman spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy are non invasive diagnostic tools that use the interaction of light within tissues to identify the chemical composition of different tissues. The use of these tools may reduce the need for invasive biopsies to diagnose and monitor women with vulval skin disease.~The aim of this project is to explore the use of vibrational spectroscopic techniques in the diagnosis of vulval skin disease.

{"_id": "NCT00771706", "title": "Longitudinal Study of Children With a Chronic Cough and the Impact of Gastroesophageal Reflux", "text": "Summary: Cough is both an important physiologic component of lung defense and a cardinal indicator of disease. For those with chronic cough, defined as cough lasting for more than 3 weeks, the differential diagnosis is broad, including self-limited, persistent, and chronic diseases. The success of a given treatment depends upon a proper diagnosis, yet this is often not obvious. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) has been proposed as one possible etiology of a chronic cough in a number of studies in the adult literature; nevertheless a clear cause and effect remains to be confirmed as there continues to be no gold standard test definitively to identify pathologic GER.

Microbiological cultures are currently regarded as the reference for identification of pathogenic bacteria. However, the sensitivity of these cultures is very variable and depends both on the context in which clinical samples are taken, and on the pathogen involved. The rate of detection varies according to infection type: from 50 to 70% for infectious spondylodiscitis, 65 to 95% for prosthetic joint infections, 50% for gonococcal arthritis and 90% for non-gonococcal arthritis. The aim of the study is to evaluate the diagnostic performances of microbiological cultures and molecular methods in case of osteoarticular infections. The gold standard will be established by an expert group of osteoarticular infection (composed by a bacteriologist, a radiologist, a surgeon, an anatomy-pathologist and a rheumatologist), which established the final diagnosis of infected or not infected patients."}}
