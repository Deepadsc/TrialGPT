{"_id": "NCT02671188", "title": "A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Mode of Action and Clinical Efficacy of GSK3050002 in Subjects With Psoriatic Arthritis", "text": "Summary: Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20 (CCL20) is a protein involved in attracting immune cells including subsets of T cells (for example Th17 cells), B cells, natural killer cells and dendritic cells to inflamed tissues in conditions such as psoriasis (Ps) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). CCL20 acts by binding and activating the chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) present on the surface of the inflammatory cells. Levels of CCL20 are increased in inflamed tissues in psoriasis (Ps) and inflammatory arthritis. GSK3050002 is a humanized Immunoglobulin G (Ig)G monoclonal antibody, which binds to and neutralizes the action of human CCL20. The hypothesis is that GSK3050002 will reduce the movement of inflammatory cells into tissues affected by Ps or PsA, thereby leading to an improvement in disease activity. The primary objective of this multi-centre, randomized, double-blind (sponsor open), placebo-controlled trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeat doses of GSK3050002, and to understand the mechanism of action (by taking skin and synovial biopsy samples) and potential for clinical efficacy of GSK3050002 in subjects with PsA. A minimum of 18 subjects and up to a maximum of 30 subjects will be randomised into the study to either GSK3050002 or placebo in a 2:1 ratio to ensure that approximately 18 evaluable subjects complete the study. The total duration of participation in the study will be approximately 21 weeks from screening to last study visit.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: \n\n Age>=18 years and <=75 years of age at the time of consent. \n\n Diagnosis of, and currently active psoriatic arthritis with >=3 tender and >=3 swollen joints, one of which must be either a knee or ankle joint suitable for synovial biopsies. \n\n C-reactive protein (CRP) >=3mg/l at the time of screening, thought by the investigator to be due to active PsA. \n\n A negative test result for Rheumatoid Factor at screening. \n\n Active PsA despite an adequate course of treatment with at least one of the following Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDS): methotrexate, sulfasalazine or leflunomide for a minimum of 3 months, with a stable dose prior to screening.

Each plaque should have a total PLSS of >=5, including an induration score of >=2 (moderate or above) and a score of >=1 in erythema and scaling. The PLSS is the sum of the erythema, scaling and induration scores.

CCL20 acts by binding and activating the chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) present on the surface of the inflammatory cells. Levels of CCL20 are increased in inflamed tissues in psoriasis (Ps) and inflammatory arthritis. GSK3050002 is a humanized Immunoglobulin G (Ig)G monoclonal antibody, which binds to and neutralizes the action of human CCL20. The hypothesis is that GSK3050002 will reduce the movement of inflammatory cells into tissues affected by Ps or PsA, thereby leading to an improvement in disease activity. The primary objective of this multi-centre, randomized, double-blind (sponsor open), placebo-controlled trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeat doses of GSK3050002, and to understand the mechanism of action (by taking skin and synovial biopsy samples) and potential for clinical efficacy of GSK3050002 in subjects with PsA. A minimum of 18 subjects and up to a maximum of 30 subjects will be randomised into the study to either GSK3050002 or placebo in a 2:1 ratio to ensure that approximately 18 evaluable subjects complete the study. The total duration of participation in the study will be approximately 21 weeks from screening to last study visit."}}
