Anxiety itself can have a significant effect on the developing baby, on the newborn child and the mother-infant bonding process. We will use a combination of pregnancy blood tests and an ultrasound assessment to check on placental function, since placental damage is the greatest cause of poor outcome. Most women tested this way will have normal results, and so may feel reassured and do better in pregnancy than untested women. The benefits may extend after birth to mother-infant bonding, breastfeeding success and a reduced risk of postnatal depression. We will randomly select an equal number of women for testing and no testing (like tossing a coin, known as a randomized control trial) to be confident that any benefits observed are genuine. The potential benefits of our research would be substantial for the mental health of many pregnant women, for their newborn and for their children as they grow up.

The program utilizes a naturopathic dietary approach, education on cooking and food consumption choices, walking physical exercise, Qi Gong - a form of Chinese slow movement exercise combined with relaxation breathing and imagery and group therapy coaching in stress management techniques and mind-body balancing techniques.~Trial Objectives:~To compare the effect of CALM in reducing blood pressure to the standard dietary DASH approach in hypertensive patients.~Methodology:~120 Participants will be randomly assigned in to two groups:~CALM program for reducing blood pressure as the treatment group.~Standard DASH diet and lifestyle modification counseling as the control group. Inclusion Criteria~Adult men and women over 18 years.~Patients using anti hypertensive medications with mean systolic blood pressure measurements of 120-180 mm Hg and/or mean diastolic measurements of 70-100 mm Hg as determined by a 24 hour Holter test.~Patients not using anti hypertensive medications with mean systolic blood pressure measurements of 130-180 mm Hg and or mean diastolic measurements of 80-100 mmHg.~Signed informed consent (appears in IRB forms)~Assessment of Efficacy Primary end point efficacy will be assessed by comparing the mean BP measurements in the CALM group to the mean BP measurements in the DASH control group. Blood pressure measurements will be performed by 24 hours Holter BP monitoring in the beginning and at the end of the trial.~Secondary end points efficacy will be assed by comparing CALM to DASH programs with respect to effects use of BP medications and weight loss.

The proposed clinical trial is a within-participant, double-blind, randomized, phase I controlled study evaluating the toxicology, biodistribution and potential activity of re-administration of rAAV9-DES-hGAA injected intramuscularly into the TA. Nine participants (18 to 50-years old) who reside within the United States with Late-Onset Pompe Disease (LOPD) will be included. The goal of the immune modulation strategy is to ablate B-cells (Rituximab and Sirolimus) prior to the initial exposure to the study agent in one leg and the subsequent exposure of the same vector to the contralateral leg after four months. At each study agent dosing, the contralateral leg will receive excipient. Patients will act as their own controls.

While most patients have a mild or uncomplicated disease (80%), approximately 15% need hospital care and 5% intensive care. Severe cases are characterized by pulmonary involvement which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Early identification of patients who are likely to get worse is therefore a major issue.~While, chest X-ray has poor diagnostic performances, pulmonary computed tomography (CT scan) seems very sensitive (97%) and quite specific of COVID-19. Sub-pleural bilateral ground-glass pattern can precede the positivity of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. CT scan is now considered as the best imaging test to assess COVID-19 patients and is recommended as first-line diagnosis tool by the French Society of Radiology (SFR). However, performing CT scan in all or many patients with suspected COVID-19 may result in radiology department overload, especially, taking into account bio-cleaning between patients. Moreover, CT scan may lead to adverse effects including induced cancer due to the cumulative diagnostic irradiation.~Chest ultrasonography may be an alternative to CT scan. It is a simple, non-invasive, non-irradiating, inexpensive and available at the point of care (POCUS). Most of emergency physicians and many other specialists (pneumologists, infectious disease or intensive care physicians) are trained to perform chest POCUS and use it in their everyday practice. Multiple studies have demonstrated its superiority to chest X-ray for the detection of pneumonia. In ARDS, a scoring has been developed and has shown good correlation with mortality. POCUS is very effective in detecting peripheral patterns and seems appropriate to explore COVID-19 patients.~Previous studies suggest its interest in SARSCov2 infections for initial patient assessment and identification of lung damage. However, its performances have never been scientifically evaluated to date.~Our main hypothesis is that point of care lung ultrasonography performed during the initial examination may identify high-risk COVID-19 patients.\n\n### Criterion-level Eligibility Predictions:\ninclusion criterion 0: Patient with COVID-19 confirmed by positive RT-PCR or considered as probable by the in-charge physician,\n\tPatient relevance: The patient's diagnosis is not mentioned as COVID-19, and there is no indication of a positive RT-PCR test for COVID-19.\n\tPatient eligibility: not included\ninclusion criterion 1: \u226518 years old,\n\tPatient relevance: The patient is 61 years old.\n\tEvident sentences: [0]\n\tPatient eligibility: included\ninclusion criterion 2: Not requiring respiratory assistance and/or other intensive care\n\tPatient relevance: There is no information suggesting that the patient requires respiratory assistance or other intensive care.\n\tPatient eligibility: not enough information\ninclusion criterion 3: Not subject to a limitation of active therapeutics\n\tPatient relevance: There is no information suggesting that the patient is subject to a limitation of active therapeutics.\n\tPatient eligibility: not enough information\nexclusion criterion 0: History of pneumonectomy\n\tPatient relevance: No mention of pneumonectomy in the patient's medical history.\n\tPatient eligibility: not excluded\nexclusion criterion 1: Any reason making chest ultrasonography impossible\n\tPatient relevance: No evidence in the patient note that suggests an impossibility to perform chest ultrasonography.\n\tPatient eligibility: not excluded\nexclusion criterion 2: Any reason making 14-day follow-up impossible\n\tPatient relevance: The patient has agreed to comply with the trial protocol, indicating ability to follow up.\n\tEvident sentences: [9]\n\tPatient eligibility: not excluded\nexclusion criterion 3: Patient opposition to research participation.\n\tPatient relevance: The patient will provide informed consent, indicating no opposition to research participation.\n\tEvident sentences: [9]\n\tPatient eligibility: not excluded\n\n\n### Output Instructions:\n- **Provide ONLY a valid JSON object** with the exact structure below:\n```json\n{\n  \"relevance_explanation\": \"Your detailed reasoning for the relevance score\",\n  \"relevance_score_R\": float_value_between_0_and_100,\n  \"eligibility_explanation\": \"Your detailed reasoning for the eligibility score\",\n  \"eligibility_score_E\": float_value_between_negative_R_and_positive_R\n}\n```\n\n- **Critical Rules:**\n  1. **Do NOT include any text outside of the JSON object.**\n  2.

This can result in an abnormally shaped head, wide-set eyes, and flattened cheekbones. Patients may also have an enlarged head, abnormalities of the hands or feet, and hearing loss.~The fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene, which is involved in the development and maintenance of bone tissue, plays a role in Muenke syndrome. In some cases, the FGFR3 mutation is inherited from a parent with Muenke syndrome; in other cases, where there is no family history of the disorder, the mutation occurs anew. A better understanding of this gene may lead researchers to develop better treatments and genetic counseling for people affected by Muenke syndrome.~Patients with Muenke syndrome and their blood relatives may be eligible for this study. Family members with confirmed Muenke syndrome will have genetic counseling, and patients undergo the following tests and procedures:~Review of medical records and test results.~Questionnaires about the patient's prenatal, birth, newborn, and past medical history; family history; growth and development; medications; and current therapies.~Physical, neurological, ear, nose and throat, dental, and eye examinations.~Neuropsychological testing to assess cognitive thinking abilities.~Hearing evaluation. This includes an audiology test in which the patients listens to soft tones through earphones; a power reflectance test in which a chirping sound is heard through an earpiece placed at the entrance to the ear canal, and possibly an ABR/ASSR test, in which electrodes are attached to the forehead, earlobes, and behind the ears to measure brain waves in response to certain conditions.~MRI scan of the brain. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed pictures of the brain. During the scan, the patient lies on a table in a narrow cylinder (the scanner), wearing ear plugs to muffle loud noises that occur with electrical switching of the magnetic fields.~MRI scan of the middle and inner ear. This test is similar to the MRI, but uses a dye injected in a vein to enhance the images.~CT scan of the skull. CT uses x-rays to produce 3-dimensional images of the part of the body studied.~Dental evaluation with x-rays.~Skeletal survey (x-rays of all bones of the body).~Developmental assessment of IQ testing.~Blood tests for research purposes. A cell line may be established for use in future research.~Medical photographs to demonstrate clinical features, including side and front views of the face, head, and other parts of the body that may be involved in Muenke syndrome, like the hands and feet.~Other consultations or tests as clinically indicated\n\n### Criterion-level Eligibility Predictions:\ninclusion criterion 0: Subjects who have had confirmation of a Pro250Arg mutation in FGFR3 by a CLIA-certified laboratory.

There are still no reliable methods to identify patients with pCR before radical surgery. As a result, clinical complete response (cCR), defined as no clinical detectable tumor by physical examination, endoscopic evaluation, and imaging, is designed as a surrogate endpoint for pCR. However, the concordance between cCR and pCR varies from 22% to 96% in different reports, which questions the clinical value of such strategies. Therefore, based on rectal diginal examination, serum CEA, MRI, endoscopy examination, we suggested to add multi-points and full-thickness biopsy technique to further improve the accuracy of cCR.\n\n### Criterion-level Eligibility Predictions:\ninclusion criterion 0: Adult male and female, between 18 and 80 years old;\n\tPatient relevance: The patient is a 63-year-old man, which fits within the age range of 18 to 80 years.\n\tEvident sentences: [0]\n\tPatient eligibility: included\ninclusion criterion 1: Colonoscopy biopsy pathology confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma;\n\tPatient relevance: The patient has a diagnosis of diffuse-type adenocarcinoma in the stomach, not colorectal adenocarcinoma.\n\tEvident sentences: [5]\n\tPatient eligibility: not included\ninclusion criterion 2: The distance from the lower margin of the tumor to the anal margin \u226412 cm (endoscope) or to the anorectal ring \u22648 cm;\n\tPatient relevance: The patient's tumor is in the stomach, not within the specified distance from the anal margin as required for rectal cancer.\n\tEvident sentences: [5]\n\tPatient eligibility: not included\ninclusion criterion 3: The hematopoietic functions of heart, lung, liver, kidney and bone marrow meet the requirements of surgery and anesthesia;\n\tPatient relevance: There is no information provided about the hematopoietic functions of the patient's heart, lung, liver, kidney, and bone marrow.\n\tPatient eligibility: not enough information\ninclusion criterion 4: Initial local MRI stage was T2 or T3A or T3B, N0-2, negative for extramural vascular invasion (EMVI), circumferential ential resection margin (CRM), and no peripheral iliac, common iliac, obturator, or abdominal aortic lymph node metastasis;\n\tPatient relevance: The patient's tumor is in the stomach, not the rectum, and there is no MRI staging information provided for a rectal tumor.\n\tEvident sentences: [5]\n\tPatient eligibility: not included\ninclusion criterion 5: CCR patients evaluated after neoadjuvant therapy (no mass or ulcer found on digital rectal examination;Endoscopic examination showed no other changes except flat scar, telangiectasia or pallor of mucosa.MRI or rectal ultrasound showed no residual tumor in the primary site and lymphatic drainage area.Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was normal.\n\tPatient relevance: The patient has not undergone neoadjuvant therapy for rectal cancer, and the findings are not consistent with cCR criteria.\n\tEvident sentences: [5]\n\tPatient eligibility: not included\ninclusion criterion 6: Signing informed consent for surgery.\n\tPatient relevance: The patient has agreed to provide informed consent and comply with the trial protocol.\n\tEvident sentences: [6]\n\tPatient eligibility: included\nexclusion criterion 0: Previous history of malignant colorectal tumor;\n\tPatient relevance: The patient has a diagnosis of diffuse-type adenocarcinoma of the stomach, not colorectal cancer.\n\tEvident sentences: [5]\n\tPatient eligibility: not excluded\nexclusion criterion 1: Patients complicated with intestinal obstruction, intestinal perforation, intestinal bleeding and other patients requiring emergency surgery;\n\tPatient relevance: There is no mention of intestinal obstruction, perforation, bleeding, or emergency surgery needs.\n\tPatient eligibility: not excluded\nexclusion criterion 2: Unresectable lymph node metastasis;\n\tPatient relevance: There is no information about lymph node metastasis.\n\tPatient eligibility: not enough information\nexclusion criterion 3: Recently diagnosed with other malignant tumors;\n\tPatient relevance: The patient was recently diagnosed with diffuse-type adenocarcinoma of the stomach, which is a different malignant tumor.\n\tEvident sentences: [5]\n\tPatient eligibility: excluded\nexclusion criterion 4: Patients who had participated in or were participating in other clinical trials within 4 weeks prior to enrollment;\n\tPatient relevance: There is no information suggesting the patient has participated in other clinical trials.\n\tPatient eligibility: not excluded\nexclusion criterion 5: ASA rating \u2265IV and/or ECOG physical status score \u22652 points;\n\tPatient relevance: No information on ASA rating or ECOG physical status score is provided.\n\tPatient eligibility: not enough information\nexclusion criterion 6: Patients with severe liver and kidney function, cardiopulmonary function, coagulation dysfunction or combined with serious basic diseases cannot tolerate surgery;\n\tPatient relevance: There is no mention of severe organ dysfunction or serious basic diseases.\n\tPatient eligibility: not excluded\nexclusion criterion 7: a history of serious mental illness;\n\tPatient relevance: No history of serious mental illness is mentioned.\n\tPatient eligibility: not excluded\nexclusion criterion 8: -

After 1 year of trying, 1 out of every 7 women will not be pregnant. This is called infertility. This results in significant distress and anxiety. Infertility is common; however, the investigators have no markers to predict who will be infertile. For couples diagnosed with infertility, the investigators have used blood and urine hormone levels (follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), inhibin B, and antimullerian hormone (AMH)) to tell us who will get pregnant with fertility treatment. The investigators don't know if these hormone levels can predict if regular people trying to get pregnant will be able to get pregnant.

Urate crystal deposition is responsible for acute and recurrent inflammatory flares which can be treated with colchicine, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), corticosteroid or interleukin (IL)-1b blockade. Colchicine and NSAID are contra-indicated in patients with chronic renal disease (CKD) stage 4/5 or with renal transplantation. In these patients gout flare is treated with high dose of corticosteroid or IL-1b inhibitors.~Frequent use of high dose of corticosteroid can worsen gout comorbidities including mellitus diabetes type 2, hypertension, obesity and dyslipidemia. Anakinra, an IL-1b receptor antagonist, is efficient in gout flare in patients without CKD stage 4/5.~The aim of this study is to demonstrate that anakinra is superior to prednisone to treat gout

Microbiological cultures are currently regarded as the reference for identification of pathogenic bacteria. However, the sensitivity of these cultures is very variable and depends both on the context in which clinical samples are taken, and on the pathogen involved. The rate of detection varies according to infection type: from 50 to 70% for infectious spondylodiscitis, 65 to 95% for prosthetic joint infections, 50% for gonococcal arthritis and 90% for non-gonococcal arthritis. The aim of the study is to evaluate the diagnostic performances of microbiological cultures and molecular methods in case of osteoarticular infections. The gold standard will be established by an expert group of osteoarticular infection (composed by a bacteriologist, a radiologist, a surgeon, an anatomy-pathologist and a rheumatologist), which established the final diagnosis of infected or not infected patients.\n\n### Criterion-level Eligibility Predictions:\ninclusion criterion 0: Patient are more than 18 years old\n\tPatient relevance: The patient is 39 years old, which is above the age of 18.\n\tEvident sentences: [0]\n\tPatient eligibility: included\ninclusion criterion 1: Patient who do not declined to have his medical records reviewed for research\n\tPatient relevance: The patient note does not mention any refusal to have medical records reviewed for research.\n\tPatient eligibility: included\ninclusion criterion 2: Spondylodiscitis (S) group:\n\tPatient relevance: The patient does not have spondylodiscitis; he has gouty arthritis.\n\tEvident sentences: [3, 8]\n\tPatient eligibility: not applicable\ninclusion criterion 3: Patients suspected of Discitis and/or Vertebral Osteomyelitis is defined by the need of spinal biopsy in infectious context.

The proposed clinical trial is a within-participant, double-blind, randomized, phase I controlled study evaluating the toxicology, biodistribution and potential activity of re-administration of rAAV9-DES-hGAA injected intramuscularly into the TA. Nine participants (18 to 50-years old) who reside within the United States with Late-Onset Pompe Disease (LOPD) will be included. The goal of the immune modulation strategy is to ablate B-cells (Rituximab and Sirolimus) prior to the initial exposure to the study agent in one leg and the subsequent exposure of the same vector to the contralateral leg after four months. At each study agent dosing, the contralateral leg will receive excipient. Patients will act as their own controls. Repeated measures, at baseline and during the following 3 months after each injection, will assess the safety, biochemical and functional impact of the vector.\n\n### Criterion-level Eligibility

Pneumonic plague is typically diagnosed in humans with high mortality. It has a long history for plague as an agent of biowarfare, and poses a serious threat to international security. Althought the killed whole-cell plague vaccine and live attenuated vaccine have been licensed, they are rarely used today because of toxicities, limited evidence for efficacy to prevent plague, and limited commercial availability. In the last twenty years,the recombinant subunit vaccines comprised by fraction 1 capsule(F1)and virulence-associated (V)antigens as the main composition have caused widely attention with providing greater protection than vaccines comprised of either subunit alone. This study was aimed to explor the safety and immunogenicity of a new type plague subunit vaccine which comprised natural F1 antigen and recombined V antigen (F1+rV).\n\n### Criterion-level
