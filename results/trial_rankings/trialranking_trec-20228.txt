Patient ID: trec-20228
Patient Summary: A 7-month-old boy presents with chronic constipation and discomfort during bowel movements since birth, which worsened after the introduction of semi-solid foods. He exhibits abdominal distension and tenderness, and an X-ray with barium revealed a narrow rectum and rectosigmoid area with dilation of the proximal colon. A digital rectal exam showed a burst of feces, and a biopsy confirmed the absence of submucosal ganglia in the distal large intestine, indicative of Hirschsprung's disease.

Clinical trial ranking:
NCT04786795: matching_score=-1.0, agg_score=0.0, trial_score=-1.0, qrels_score=1
Brief Summary: To confirm the clinical efficacy of Compound Azintamide Enteric-coated Tablets in the treatment of patients with dyspepsia after cholecystectomy (such as abdominal distension, abdominal pain/abdominal discomfort, diarrhea/fatty stool, early satiety, belching, loss of appetite, etc.) by comparing with positive control drug, to observe its safety, and to evaluate the quality of life of subjects before and after treatment
Relevance Explanation: The patient is a 7-month-old boy with symptoms of a gastrointestinal condition, specifically related to a narrow rectum and absence of submucosal ganglia, indicative of Hirschsprung's disease. This condition and the patient's age make him completely irrelevant to the clinical trial, which targets adults with dyspeptic symptoms following a cholecystectomy. None of the patient's symptoms or medical history align with the trial's focus on post-cholecystectomy dyspepsia.
Eligibility Explanation: Given the patient's complete irrelevance to the clinical trial, as he does not meet any of the inclusion criteria and the trial's focus does not align with his medical condition, the eligibility score is also zero. The patient's age, lack of cholecystectomy, and unrelated symptoms disqualify him from participation.

NCT02774746: matching_score=-1.0, agg_score=0.0, trial_score=-1.0, qrels_score=1
Brief Summary: The objective of this study is to investigate the hypothesis that delivery at 35 0/7- 35 6/7 weeks in stable patients with gastroschisis is superior to observation and expectant management with a goal of delivery at 38 0/7 - 38 6/7 weeks. To test this hypothesis, we will complete a randomized, prospective, multi-institutional trial across NAFTNet-affiliated institutions. Patients may be enrolled in the study any time prior to 33 weeks, but will be randomized at 33 weeks to delivery at 35 weeks or observation with a goal of 38 weeks. The primary composite outcome will include stillbirth, neonatal death prior to discharge, respiratory morbidity, and need for parenteral nutrition at 30 days.
Relevance Explanation: The patient is a 7-month-old boy with symptoms of Hirschsprung's disease, which is unrelated to gastroschisis, the focus of the clinical trial. The trial is designed for pregnant women dealing with fetal gastroschisis, making the patient's condition and circumstances completely irrelevant to the study's objectives and target population.
Eligibility Explanation: Given the patient's complete irrelevance to the trial, as he does not meet any of the inclusion criteria nor does he fall under the scope of the study's target condition or demographic, his eligibility score is the lowest possible within the defined range, matching his relevance score.
