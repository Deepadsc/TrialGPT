Patient ID: trec-202212
Patient Summary: A 47-year-old male with a history of chronic cough, progressive dyspnea, hypertension, and osteoarthritis presents with symptoms suggestive of asbestos-related lung disease. He has a smoking history and previous occupational exposure to asbestos as a construction worker. Examination and imaging findings indicate pulmonary fibrosis, predominantly in the lower lobes, with evidence of asbestos bodies, and mild bilateral pleural effusion with diffuse pleural thickening.

Clinical trial ranking:
NCT03462056: matching_score=-1.0, agg_score=0.0, trial_score=-1.0, qrels_score=1
Brief Summary: Children with cystic fibrosis require increased caloric intake to maintain appropriate growth, an important determinant of long-term outcomes. This study seeks to determine the feasibility of using a novel therapeutic food to promote weight gain and growth in children with cystic fibrosis.
Relevance Explanation: The patient has pulmonary fibrosis and asbestosis, which are different from cystic fibrosis, the target condition of the clinical trial. The trial is specifically designed for children with cystic fibrosis to assess a nutritional intervention, which does not align with the patient's condition or demographic (adult).
Eligibility Explanation: The patient does not meet any of the inclusion criteria as he does not have cystic fibrosis, is not receiving pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, and there is no information on his BMI or weight percentile relevant to the trial's focus on children. Additionally, none of the exclusion criteria apply directly to him since they are specific to conditions and treatments associated with cystic fibrosis, which he does not have.

NCT04541160: matching_score=-1.8, agg_score=0.0, trial_score=-1.8, qrels_score=1
Brief Summary: This is a randomized study that sought to compare the rule-out capacity and antibiotics prescriptions associated with two different diagnostic imaging strategies (ultra-low-dose chest computed tomography versus chest radiography) in a group of healthy adults presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
Relevance Explanation: The patient presents with respiratory symptoms, which aligns with the clinical trial's focus on diagnosing respiratory conditions like pneumonia using imaging techniques. However, the patient's symptoms and conditions (chronic cough, dyspnea, asbestosis, and pulmonary fibrosis) are not primarily indicative of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), which is the specific target of the trial. This discrepancy between the patient's actual conditions and the trial's target condition affects the relevance score.
Eligibility Explanation: While the patient does exhibit respiratory symptoms relevant to the trial's inclusion criteria, he does not meet the specific criteria for suspected CAP, lacks symptoms related to infection, and has a definitive diagnosis of other respiratory diseases (asbestosis and pulmonary fibrosis), which are exclusion criteria for the trial. Therefore, despite some initial relevance due to respiratory symptoms, the patient's specific medical conditions and the presence of other respiratory diseases make him ineligible for the trial.
