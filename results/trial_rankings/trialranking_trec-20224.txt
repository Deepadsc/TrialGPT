Patient ID: trec-20224
Patient Summary: A 66-year-old woman presents with joint pain in her hands and knees, associated with morning stiffness lasting less than 30 minutes. She experiences moderate to severe pain that worsens with activity and minimal relief from Tylenol. Physical examination reveals firm nodules over the distal interphalangeal joints and symptoms of bone friction. X-ray findings include joint space narrowing, subchondral bone sclerosis, and osteophyte formation, indicative of osteoarthritis. She also has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.

Clinical trial ranking:
NCT01813916: matching_score=1.0, agg_score=1.9, trial_score=2.9, qrels_score=2
Brief Summary: The purpose of this study is to use the proteomic analysis of synovial fluid to perform the comprehensive investigation of the biomarker that will be useful to assign the tratment effectiveness of five weekly intra-articular HA injection.
Relevance Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation and diagnostic findings align closely with the target condition of the clinical trial, which is osteoarthritis. The symptoms described, such as joint pain, morning stiffness, and the presence of osteophytes, along with X-ray findings indicating joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis, are characteristic of osteoarthritis. These factors make the trial highly relevant to the patient's condition.
Eligibility Explanation: The patient meets all the inclusion criteria specified for the clinical trial. She has a clinical diagnosis of osteoarthritis, as evidenced by her symptoms and X-ray findings. Additionally, she has agreed to comply with the trial protocol, which includes accepting intra-articular HA injection therapy. There are no exclusion criteria mentioned in the provided data, and the patient's other medical conditions (hypertension and hypercholesteremia) do not appear to disqualify her from participation.

NCT00409149: matching_score=0.5, agg_score=1.2, trial_score=1.7, qrels_score=2
Brief Summary: Intervention description:~Complementary Approaches to Lower Mean arterial pressure (CALM) is a multi dispensary program aimed to reduce blood pressure in hypertensive patients. The program utilizes a naturopathic dietary approach, education on cooking and food consumption choices, walking physical exercise, Qi Gong - a form of Chinese slow movement exercise combined with relaxation breathing and imagery and group therapy coaching in stress management techniques and mind-body balancing techniques.~Trial Objectives:~To compare the effect of CALM in reducing blood pressure to the standard dietary DASH approach in hypertensive patients.~Methodology:~120 Participants will be randomly assigned in to two groups:~CALM program for reducing blood pressure as the treatment group.~Standard DASH diet and lifestyle modification counseling as the control group. Inclusion Criteria~Adult men and women over 18 years.~Patients using anti hypertensive medications with mean systolic blood pressure measurements of 120-180 mm Hg and/or mean diastolic measurements of 70-100 mm Hg as determined by a 24 hour Holter test.~Patients not using anti hypertensive medications with mean systolic blood pressure measurements of 130-180 mm Hg and or mean diastolic measurements of 80-100 mmHg.~Signed informed consent (appears in IRB forms)~Assessment of Efficacy Primary end point efficacy will be assessed by comparing the mean BP measurements in the CALM group to the mean BP measurements in the DASH control group. Blood pressure measurements will be performed by 24 hours Holter BP monitoring in the beginning and at the end of the trial.~Secondary end points efficacy will be assed by comparing CALM to DASH programs with respect to effects use of BP medications and weight loss. Lab test and pulse wave analysis will also be assessed at the beginning and at the end of the study.
Relevance Explanation: The patient is relevant to the clinical trial as she has a documented history of hypertension, which is the primary target condition of the trial. The trial aims to explore interventions to manage blood pressure in hypertensive patients, directly aligning with the patient's medical condition.
Eligibility Explanation: The patient meets the age criterion and has agreed to provide informed consent, which are both inclusion criteria. However, there is insufficient information regarding her current blood pressure measurements and whether she is on antihypertensive medications, which are crucial to determine her full eligibility. She does not meet any of the exclusion criteria based on the available information. Therefore, while she is relevant to the trial, her complete eligibility cannot be confirmed without additional data on her blood pressure status.
