Patient ID: trec-202217
Patient Summary: A 67-year-old man presents with progressively worsening bilateral vision, particularly impaired during nighttime, affecting his ability to drive. Ocular examination reveals a loss of the red reflex and blurry vision, with an acuity testing result of 50/100 in both eyes but normal visual fields. His medical history is otherwise unremarkable, and his general physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse, is within normal limits.

Clinical trial ranking:
NCT00335920: matching_score=-0.5, agg_score=0.0, trial_score=-0.5, qrels_score=1
Brief Summary: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an intratympanic continuous two-week application of dexamethasone compared to placebo using a temporarily implanted catheter in patients with severe to profound sudden sensorineural hearing loss and insufficient recovery after initial systemic prednisolone therapy.
Relevance Explanation: The patient's primary health issue is related to vision impairment, specifically worsening vision and loss of the red reflex, which are not related to the target condition of the clinical trial, sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Therefore, the trial, which focuses on hearing loss treatment, is not relevant to the patient's condition.
Eligibility Explanation: Since the patient's condition (vision problems) does not match the target condition of the trial (sudden hearing loss), he does not meet the primary inclusion criteria related to the diagnosis of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Consequently, he is ineligible for the trial.

NCT04224909: matching_score=-1.0, agg_score=0.0, trial_score=-1.0, qrels_score=1
Brief Summary: The function of the vestibular system among patients with Sudden Sensori Neural Hearing Loss will be evaluted using the video Head Impulse Test
Relevance Explanation: The patient's primary health issue is related to vision impairment, specifically worsening vision and loss of the red reflex, which are not related to the target condition of the clinical trial, Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss. The trial focuses on evaluating the vestibular system using the video Head Impulse Test in patients with hearing loss, which does not align with the patient's symptoms or medical history.
Eligibility Explanation: Since the patient does not have Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss, he does not meet the primary inclusion criterion of the trial. Additionally, none of the exclusion criteria apply because they are specific to conditions not mentioned in the patient's note. Therefore, the patient is completely ineligible for this trial as his condition does not match the trial's focus.
