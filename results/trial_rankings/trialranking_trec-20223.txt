Patient ID: trec-20223
Patient Summary: A 51-year-old man presents with fatigue, sexual dysfunction including reduced libido, and increased skin pigmentation. He has a normal blood pressure, pulse, and BMI, and does not smoke or use illicit drugs. Genetic testing reveals homozygosity for the C282Y mutation, and laboratory results indicate elevated transferrin saturation and serum ferritin levels, leading to a diagnosis of hemochromatosis.

Clinical trial ranking:
NCT00495781: matching_score=-1.0, agg_score=0.0, trial_score=-1.0, qrels_score=1
Brief Summary: The purpose of the study is to define laboratory parameters which are best suited to diagnose functional iron deficiency. Functional iron deficiency is a condition where - due to the lack of iron bioavailability - the patient suffers from symptoms such as fatigue and weakness, or his/her capacity to produce red blood cells is reduced.
Relevance Explanation: The patient has hemochromatosis, characterized by high iron levels, which is the opposite of functional iron deficiency targeted by the trial. The trial aims to study parameters for diagnosing functional iron deficiency, where there is a lack of iron bioavailability. The patient's condition involves excessive iron, making the trial's focus irrelevant to his medical needs.
Eligibility Explanation: The patient does not meet any of the inclusion criteria specified for the clinical trial, which focus on conditions and treatments not applicable to him, such as renal anemia, dialysis, and specific therapies like erythropoietin or iron. Furthermore, none of the exclusion criteria apply to him, as they do not mention hemochromatosis or related symptoms directly. However, since the trial is not relevant to his condition, his eligibility score remains at the lowest possible.

NCT04648969: matching_score=-2.0, agg_score=0.0, trial_score=-2.0, qrels_score=1
Brief Summary: The goal of this study is to develop novel treatments for patients with a condition called hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) through the use of exogenous kisspeptin.
Relevance Explanation: The patient is diagnosed with hemochromatosis, which is distinct from hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), the target condition of the clinical trial. The trial aims to treat HH using kisspeptin, which is unrelated to the patient's condition. Therefore, the patient's condition does not match the focus of the trial, making him largely irrelevant to the study.
Eligibility Explanation: The patient is explicitly excluded from the trial due to his diagnosis of hemochromatosis, which does not meet the trial's requirement for a confirmed diagnosis of HH. Additionally, there is no information suggesting that the patient has HH or any related symptoms or treatments. Thus, he does not meet the primary inclusion criteria and is excluded based on his current medical condition.
