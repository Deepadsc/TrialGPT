Patient ID: trec-202211
Patient Summary: A 63-year-old man presents with recent unintentional weight loss and epigastric discomfort after meals. He has no prior known medical issues and takes no medications. An upper endoscopy revealed a lesion in the stomach diagnosed as diffuse-type adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells, which are characteristic of this cancer type.

Clinical trial ranking:
NCT01824459: matching_score=0.29412, agg_score=1.65, trial_score=1.94412, qrels_score=2
Brief Summary: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of S-1+Oxaliplatin vs.S-1+Cisplatin First-line Treatment in Advanced or Recurrent Non-intestinal Gastric Adenocarcinoma or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma Patients.
Relevance Explanation: The patient has been diagnosed with diffuse-type adenocarcinoma of the stomach, which is specifically targeted by the clinical trial aimed at treating advanced or recurrent non-intestinal type gastric adenocarcinoma. The trial's focus on first-line treatment for this type of cancer directly aligns with the patient's condition, making the trial highly relevant for him.
Eligibility Explanation: The patient meets several key inclusion criteria: confirmed diagnosis of the target cancer type, age within the required range, no prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and willingness to comply with the trial protocol. However, there is insufficient information regarding the patient's ECOG status, organ function, and various blood levels, which are necessary to fully determine eligibility. No exclusion criteria apply to the patient based on the available information. Therefore, while the patient is highly relevant, the lack of complete medical data prevents a full eligibility confirmation.

NCT04743102: matching_score=-1.71429, agg_score=0.0, trial_score=-1.71429, qrels_score=1
Brief Summary: Background There is currently no reliable means to restage rectal cancers after neoadjuvant chemoradiation. There are still no reliable methods to identify patients with pCR before radical surgery. As a result, clinical complete response (cCR), defined as no clinical detectable tumor by physical examination, endoscopic evaluation, and imaging, is designed as a surrogate endpoint for pCR. However, the concordance between cCR and pCR varies from 22% to 96% in different reports, which questions the clinical value of such strategies. Therefore, based on rectal diginal examination, serum CEA, MRI, endoscopy examination, we suggested to add multi-points and full-thickness biopsy technique to further improve the accuracy of cCR.
Relevance Explanation: The patient is diagnosed with diffuse-type adenocarcinoma of the stomach, which is not related to the clinical trial's focus on rectal cancer and neoadjuvant therapy for rectal cancer. The trial specifically targets conditions and treatments that are not applicable to the patient's diagnosis, making the trial irrelevant to his medical needs.
Eligibility Explanation: Given the patient's diagnosis does not match the target condition of the trial (rectal cancer vs. stomach cancer), he does not meet the fundamental inclusion criteria related to the disease type and location. Therefore, he is completely ineligible for this trial.
