Patient ID: trec-20229
Patient Summary: A 67-year-old woman presents with symptoms of choking, dysphagia, and cough, alongside a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and osteoarthritis. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. A barium swallow study indicated an abnormality in the upper esophagus, specifically an outpouching at the junction of the lower throat and upper esophagus, suggesting a possible Zenker's diverticulum.

Brief Summary: The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerance, and immunologic effects of interleukin-10 (IL-10), in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. A secondary objective is to determine if IL-10 demonstrates sufficient anti-inflammatory activity in the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis to warrant further study in a larger trial. In this study, IL-10 will be given either alone or in combination with standard therapeutic agents, usually consisting of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and/or prednisone. Patients will be eligible to receive IL-10 when there is evidence of active disease. IL-10 will be administered by subcutaneous injection at a dose of 4 Âµ (Micro)g/kg/day for 28 days.
Relevance Explanation: The patient's medical condition is unrelated to Wegener's granulomatosis, the primary focus of the clinical trial. The patient's symptoms and diagnosis pertain to an esophageal issue, specifically an outpouching in the upper esophagus, which does not align with the vasculitis or Wegener's granulomatosis targeted by the trial. Therefore, the trial is not relevant to her current medical needs.
Eligibility Explanation: Since the patient's condition does not match the specific disease (Wegener's granulomatosis) being studied in the trial, and she exceeds the age limit set by the trial criteria, she does not meet the necessary inclusion criteria. Additionally, there is no information suggesting she meets any other specific requirements set by the trial. Thus, she is completely ineligible for participation.

NCT02774746: matching_score=-1.57143, agg_score=0.0, trial_score=-1.57143, qrels_score=1
Brief Summary: The objective of this study is to investigate the hypothesis that delivery at 35 0/7- 35 6/7 weeks in stable patients with gastroschisis is superior to observation and expectant management with a goal of delivery at 38 0/7 - 38 6/7 weeks. To test this hypothesis, we will complete a randomized, prospective, multi-institutional trial across NAFTNet-affiliated institutions. Patients may be enrolled in the study any time prior to 33 weeks, but will be randomized at 33 weeks to delivery at 35 weeks or observation with a goal of 38 weeks. The primary composite outcome will include stillbirth, neonatal death prior to discharge, respiratory morbidity, and need for parenteral nutrition at 30 days.
Relevance Explanation: The patient is not relevant to the clinical trial as she does not have gastroschisis, which is the target condition of the study. Additionally, the trial is focused on outcomes related to pregnancy and delivery, specifically in cases of gastroschisis, and there is no indication that the patient is pregnant or has any related conditions.
Eligibility Explanation: Since the patient is completely irrelevant to the clinical trial due to the absence of the target condition (gastroschisis) and any related pregnancy conditions, she is also ineligible for participation in the trial.
