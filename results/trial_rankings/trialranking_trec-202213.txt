Patient ID: trec-202213
Patient Summary: A 24-year-old man presents with infertility after 18 months of unsuccessful attempts to conceive with his wife, whose medical evaluations show no abnormalities. He exhibits bilateral gynecomastia and abnormally long lower extremities. His karyotype reveals 47, XXY, confirming a diagnosis of Klinefelter syndrome. Physical examination shows normal heart and lung sounds, and his testes are described as bilateral descended and firm.

Clinical trial ranking:
NCT02956980: matching_score=-1.0, agg_score=0.0, trial_score=-1.0, qrels_score=1
Brief Summary: Differences in pDCs function related to gender have been demonstrated in adults but have never been addressed in children. Yet, differences in immune responses related to gender also exist in children, both in responses to pathogens and susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. The investigators suppose that these differences are partly linked to difference in pDCs functions. This study aim is to compare pDCs functions in children based on gender and pubertal status. This study will be performed in healthy children, boys with Klinefelter syndrome and girls with Turner syndrome.
Relevance Explanation: The patient has Klinefelter syndrome, which is specifically mentioned in the clinical trial as a condition of interest. However, the trial is focused on children, specifically targeting differences in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) functions based on gender and pubertal status in healthy children and those with Klinefelter or Turner syndrome. The patient's age of 24 years disqualifies him as the trial is designed for pediatric patients only.
Eligibility Explanation: Despite the patient's diagnosis of Klinefelter syndrome aligning with the study's interest, he is ineligible due to his age. The trial specifies inclusion of pediatric patients only, and all inclusion criteria are based on age groups that do not encompass the patient's age. Furthermore, the requirement for parental consent and the focus on children further emphasize his ineligibility.

Brief Summary: The purpose of this research study is to learn a way to measure a person's fertility. After 1 year of trying, 1 out of every 7 women will not be pregnant. This is called infertility. This results in significant distress and anxiety. Infertility is common; however, the investigators have no markers to predict who will be infertile. For couples diagnosed with infertility, the investigators have used blood and urine hormone levels (follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), inhibin B, and antimullerian hormone (AMH)) to tell us who will get pregnant with fertility treatment. The investigators don't know if these hormone levels can predict if regular people trying to get pregnant will be able to get pregnant. This study will try to determine if these hormone levels can predict fertility and infertility.
Relevance Explanation: The patient is a 24-year-old man with Klinefelter syndrome, presenting with infertility issues. The clinical trial is focused on fertility, specifically in measuring hormone levels to predict fertility in individuals. Although the trial primarily targets women, the patient's condition (infertility) is directly related to the study's focus. However, the specific criteria and target demographic of the trial (women trying to conceive) make the patient less relevant.
Eligibility Explanation: The patient does not meet any of the inclusion criteria as he is not a woman, is not in the specified age range, and has been trying to conceive for longer than the specified maximum of 3 months. Additionally, he is explicitly excluded by two criteria: having been trying to conceive for more than 3 months and having a known fertility issue (Klinefelter syndrome). Therefore, he is ineligible for the trial.
