Patient ID: trec-202215
Patient Summary: An 8-year-old boy presents with weakness and difficulty standing up from a sitting position. He has a family history suggestive of a similar condition, with an uncle who was wheelchair-bound and died young. Physical examination reveals lower extremity muscle strength of 3/5 and enlarged calf muscles. A muscle biopsy indicates an absence of dystrophin protein, leading to a diagnosis of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD).

Clinical trial ranking:
NCT03479008: matching_score=-0.75, agg_score=0.0, trial_score=-0.75, qrels_score=1
Brief Summary: Objective: Test the ability of vibration to produce physiologic, biochemical, and anatomic changes consistent with exercise that would help prevent the development of muscle weakness that occurs when patients are immobile for long periods of time.
Relevance Explanation: The patient, diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), presents with symptoms of muscle weakness and difficulty in mobility, which are not directly aligned with the trial's focus on critically ill patients or those with Post Intensive Care Syndrome. The trial aims to test a device on patients experiencing muscle weakness due to prolonged immobility typically seen in critical care settings, which differs from the genetic and progressive muscle weakness seen in DMD. Therefore, the patient's condition does not match the target conditions of the trial.
Eligibility Explanation: Although the patient does not meet the specific target conditions of the trial, he is not explicitly excluded based on the provided exclusion criteria (not being pregnant or a prisoner). However, his condition (DMD) and the trial's focus (critically ill, post-ICU muscle weakness) are mismatched, making his participation in the trial less appropriate.

NCT02240407: matching_score=-1.0, agg_score=0.0, trial_score=-1.0, qrels_score=1
Brief Summary: A recombinant AAV vector has been generated to carry the codon-optimized acid alpha-glucosidase (coGAA) gene expressed from a human desmin enhancer/promoter (DES). The proposed clinical trial is a within-participant, double-blind, randomized, phase I controlled study evaluating the toxicology, biodistribution and potential activity of re-administration of rAAV9-DES-hGAA injected intramuscularly into the TA. Nine participants (18 to 50-years old) who reside within the United States with Late-Onset Pompe Disease (LOPD) will be included. The goal of the immune modulation strategy is to ablate B-cells (Rituximab and Sirolimus) prior to the initial exposure to the study agent in one leg and the subsequent exposure of the same vector to the contralateral leg after four months. At each study agent dosing, the contralateral leg will receive excipient. Patients will act as their own controls. Repeated measures, at baseline and during the following 3 months after each injection, will assess the safety, biochemical and functional impact of the vector.
Relevance Explanation: The patient is diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), not Pompe Disease, which is the target condition for the clinical trial. Additionally, the age of the patient (8 years old) does not fall within the specified age range (18 to 50 years old) for the trial. These factors make the trial irrelevant to the patient's condition and age.
Eligibility Explanation: Given the patient's diagnosis of DMD instead of Pompe Disease, and his age being outside the specified range for the trial, he does not meet the primary inclusion criteria. Therefore, he is completely ineligible for the trial.
