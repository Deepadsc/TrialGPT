Patient ID: trec-202216
Patient Summary: A 39-year-old woman presents with arthralgias, skin nodules on her legs, and moderate hepatomegaly. The nodules are tender and located primarily on the anterior surface of the lower extremities. A chest x-ray shows enlarged hilar lymph nodes, and laboratory tests reveal an elevated ACE level. A biopsy of a skin lesion indicates noncaseating granulomas, negative for fungi and acid-fast bacilli, suggesting a diagnosis of sarcoidosis.

Clinical trial ranking:
NCT04648969: matching_score=-1.0, agg_score=0.0, trial_score=-1.0, qrels_score=1
Brief Summary: The goal of this study is to develop novel treatments for patients with a condition called hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) through the use of exogenous kisspeptin.
Relevance Explanation: The patient's medical condition and symptoms do not align with the target condition of the clinical trial, which is hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH). The patient's note does not mention any symptoms or diagnosis related to HH, such as low testosterone or estradiol levels, or low gonadotropin levels, which are key characteristics of HH. Instead, the patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a different condition, possibly sarcoidosis, indicated by noncaseating granulomas and elevated ACE levels. Therefore, the trial is not relevant to her current medical issues.
Eligibility Explanation: Since the patient's condition does not match the target condition of the clinical trial, she does not meet the primary inclusion criteria of having hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Consequently, she is ineligible for the trial as her medical condition is not what the trial aims to treat. The exclusion criteria, while mostly not excluding her, are irrelevant since the inclusion criteria are not met.

NCT03255720: matching_score=-2.0, agg_score=0.0, trial_score=-2.0, qrels_score=1
Brief Summary: Diffusion Tensor imaging of white matter degeneration in Alzheimer disease
Relevance Explanation: The patient's condition and symptoms are not related to Alzheimer's disease or cognitive impairment, which are the focus of the clinical trial. The trial is specifically designed to study white matter micro-structural changes in Alzheimer's disease using Diffusion Tensor Imaging. The patient's medical issues, including sarcoidosis and symptoms like arthralgias and nodules, do not align with the target condition of the trial.
Eligibility Explanation: Since the patient's condition does not match the target condition of the trial, she is inherently ineligible. Additionally, she is explicitly excluded due to having sarcoidosis, which is listed as a specific cause of white matter lesions that the trial aims to exclude.
