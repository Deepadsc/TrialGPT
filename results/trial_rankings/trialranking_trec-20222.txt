Patient ID: trec-20222
Patient Summary: A 32-year-old woman presents with vaginal spotting and a history of inconsistent contraceptive use, reporting her last menstrual period 10 weeks ago. Her serum Î²-hCG levels are abnormally rising but not doubling as expected in a normal early pregnancy, and pelvic ultrasound shows no gestational sac, suggesting a possible ectopic pregnancy or abnormal intrauterine pregnancy. Her medical history includes an appendectomy and recurrent complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs).

Brief Summary: Women whose pregnancies are at judged to be at risk of a poor outcome from an early delivery due to medical problems such as diabetes or high blood pressure, are often very anxious during pregnancy, at least until they know they have passed the risk period of premature birth (after 8 months). Anxiety itself can have a significant effect on the developing baby, on the newborn child and the mother-infant bonding process. We will use a combination of pregnancy blood tests and an ultrasound assessment to check on placental function, since placental damage is the greatest cause of poor outcome. Most women tested this way will have normal results, and so may feel reassured and do better in pregnancy than untested women. The benefits may extend after birth to mother-infant bonding, breastfeeding success and a reduced risk of postnatal depression. We will randomly select an equal number of women for testing and no testing (like tossing a coin, known as a randomized control trial) to be confident that any benefits observed are genuine. The potential benefits of our research would be substantial for the mental health of many pregnant women, for their newborn and for their children as they grow up. The tests are easy to do and would add very little in terms of a woman's and in terms of the total costs of prenatal care.
Relevance Explanation: The patient is not relevant to the clinical trial as she does not have a confirmed ongoing pregnancy, which is a fundamental requirement for a study focusing on mid-gestation placental function in high-risk pregnancies. The trial targets women with singleton pregnancies who are beyond the early stages of pregnancy, specifically those at risk of premature birth and related complications. The patient's current medical condition, indicated by vaginal spotting and the absence of a gestational sac, suggests she is not experiencing a viable pregnancy at this time.
Eligibility Explanation: The patient is ineligible for the clinical trial as she does not meet the basic inclusion criteria of having a confirmed ongoing singleton pregnancy. The absence of a gestational sac on ultrasound confirms that there is no current pregnancy to assess for placental function or any related high-risk conditions. Therefore, she cannot participate in a trial designed to monitor placental function and its effects on pregnancy outcomes.

Brief Summary: BufferGel is a new contraceptive gel designed to be used with a diaphragm. In addition to preventing pregnancy, BufferGel may also prevent some types of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). This study will compare BufferGel to Gynol II, a currently available contraceptive gel.
Relevance Explanation: The patient is relevant to the clinical trial as she is a sexually active woman at risk for pregnancy, which aligns with the trial's focus on evaluating a new contraceptive gel. However, her current pregnancy concerns and multiple sexual partners may affect her suitability for a trial aimed at single-partner contraception.
Eligibility Explanation: The patient meets several inclusion criteria such as general good health, normal cyclic menses, and willingness to provide informed consent. However, she is ineligible due to multiple exclusion criteria, including being likely pregnant, having abnormal vaginal spotting, and having multiple sexual partners recently, which are critical disqualifiers for this trial.
