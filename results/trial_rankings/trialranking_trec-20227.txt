Patient ID: trec-20227
Patient Summary: A 3-year-old girl presents with short stature, short limbs, a relatively large head, flat nasal bridge, and a small midface, features consistent with achondroplasia. Genetic testing confirmed an autosomal dominant point mutation in the FGFR3 gene, a condition shared with her father. This is her first medical assessment in the US, and she has not yet received any treatment for her condition. Her mental and developmental examinations show no abnormalities.

Clinical trial ranking:
NCT04020913: matching_score=-0.66667, agg_score=0.0, trial_score=-0.66667, qrels_score=1
Brief Summary: The purpose of the study is to measure the functional effects of recombinant GH in skeletal muscle, in addition to growth promotion, in short prepubertal boys with either growth hormone deficiency or idiopathic short stature. Patients will be similarly short. The investigators will also compare these values in the short stature cohort to those obtained in testing performed in normally growing age-matched healthy control boys not on GH. The group on GH will be studied before and after 6 and 12 months of GH treatment.
Relevance Explanation: The patient is a 3-year-old girl with achondroplasia, a genetic condition causing short stature. However, the clinical trial specifically targets prepubertal boys aged 6-11 years with growth hormone deficiency or idiopathic short stature, not achondroplasia. Therefore, the patient's condition and demographic characteristics (age and gender) do not align with the trial's target group, making her largely irrelevant to the trial.
Eligibility Explanation: The patient does not meet the primary inclusion criteria of the trial, which are gender-specific (boys only) and age-specific (6-11 years). Additionally, her condition of achondroplasia does not fall under the conditions being studied (GH deficiency or idiopathic short stature). Although she is naive to GH therapy, which aligns with one inclusion criterion, her overall eligibility is negated by the more critical demographic and condition-specific criteria.

Brief Summary: This study will explore the range and type of medical and developmental problems in patients with Muenke syndrome, a condition that results when one or more of the suture between the bones of the skull close before birth. Because of the premature closure, the skull is not able to grow in its natural shape; instead, it compensates with growth in areas of the skull where the sutures have not yet closed. This can result in an abnormally shaped head, wide-set eyes, and flattened cheekbones. Patients may also have an enlarged head, abnormalities of the hands or feet, and hearing loss.~The fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene, which is involved in the development and maintenance of bone tissue, plays a role in Muenke syndrome. In some cases, the FGFR3 mutation is inherited from a parent with Muenke syndrome; in other cases, where there is no family history of the disorder, the mutation occurs anew. A better understanding of this gene may lead researchers to develop better treatments and genetic counseling for people affected by Muenke syndrome.~Patients with Muenke syndrome and their blood relatives may be eligible for this study. Family members with confirmed Muenke syndrome will have genetic counseling, and patients undergo the following tests and procedures:~Review of medical records and test results.~Questionnaires about the patient's prenatal, birth, newborn, and past medical history; family history; growth and development; medications; and current therapies.~Physical, neurological, ear, nose and throat, dental, and eye examinations.~Neuropsychological testing to assess cognitive thinking abilities.~Hearing evaluation. This includes an audiology test in which the patients listens to soft tones through earphones; a power reflectance test in which a chirping sound is heard through an earpiece placed at the entrance to the ear canal, and possibly an ABR/ASSR test, in which electrodes are attached to the forehead, earlobes, and behind the ears to measure brain waves in response to certain conditions.~MRI scan of the brain. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed pictures of the brain. During the scan, the patient lies on a table in a narrow cylinder (the scanner), wearing ear plugs to muffle loud noises that occur with electrical switching of the magnetic fields.~MRI scan of the middle and inner ear. This test is similar to the MRI, but uses a dye injected in a vein to enhance the images.~CT scan of the skull. CT uses x-rays to produce 3-dimensional images of the part of the body studied.~Dental evaluation with x-rays.~Skeletal survey (x-rays of all bones of the body).~Developmental assessment of IQ testing.~Blood tests for research purposes. A cell line may be established for use in future research.~Medical photographs to demonstrate clinical features, including side and front views of the face, head, and other parts of the body that may be involved in Muenke syndrome, like the hands and feet.~Other consultations or tests as clinically indicated
Relevance Explanation: The patient has a confirmed mutation in the FGFR3 gene, which is relevant to the study's focus on FGFR3-related conditions. However, the specific mutation and condition (achondroplasia) differ from those targeted by the trial (Muenke syndrome with Pro250Arg mutation). This genetic distinction significantly reduces the relevance of the trial to this patient.
Eligibility Explanation: The patient is ineligible for the clinical trial as she does not meet any of the inclusion criteria specific to Muenke syndrome. She has a different FGFR3 mutation associated with achondroplasia, not the Pro250Arg mutation required for the study. Additionally, she is excluded by the criterion that aims to include only individuals with Muenke syndrome and their families.
