Patient ID: trec-20225
Patient Summary: A 23-year-old man experienced syncope during physical activity, with a history of similar episodes over the past year. He has a harsh systolic murmur and echocardiography revealed asymmetric interventricular septal hypertrophy. There is a family history of sudden death, as his father died suddenly at age 35. No use of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs is reported.

Brief Summary: A recombinant AAV vector has been generated to carry the codon-optimized acid alpha-glucosidase (coGAA) gene expressed from a human desmin enhancer/promoter (DES). The proposed clinical trial is a within-participant, double-blind, randomized, phase I controlled study evaluating the toxicology, biodistribution and potential activity of re-administration of rAAV9-DES-hGAA injected intramuscularly into the TA. Nine participants (18 to 50-years old) who reside within the United States with Late-Onset Pompe Disease (LOPD) will be included. The goal of the immune modulation strategy is to ablate B-cells (Rituximab and Sirolimus) prior to the initial exposure to the study agent in one leg and the subsequent exposure of the same vector to the contralateral leg after four months. At each study agent dosing, the contralateral leg will receive excipient. Patients will act as their own controls. Repeated measures, at baseline and during the following 3 months after each injection, will assess the safety, biochemical and functional impact of the vector.
Relevance Explanation: The patient's medical condition, as described in the patient note, is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, not Pompe disease. The clinical trial specifically targets patients with Late-Onset Pompe Disease, and there is no indication in the patient note that the patient has this condition. Therefore, the patient's condition does not match the target condition of the clinical trial, making the trial largely irrelevant to the patient.
Eligibility Explanation: Although the patient fits the age criterion for the trial, he does not have a diagnosis of Pompe disease, which is a critical inclusion criterion for this trial. The absence of this diagnosis makes him ineligible for the trial despite meeting the age requirement and not being excluded by any of the exclusion criteria explicitly. The patient's eligibility is significantly negative due to the lack of a Pompe disease diagnosis.

NCT04648969: matching_score=-2.0, agg_score=0.0, trial_score=-2.0, qrels_score=1
Brief Summary: The goal of this study is to develop novel treatments for patients with a condition called hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) through the use of exogenous kisspeptin.
Relevance Explanation: The patient's symptoms and medical history are indicative of a cardiovascular issue, specifically related to asymmetric interventricular septal hypertrophy, rather than hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH). The clinical trial is focused on treating HH with kisspeptin, which is unrelated to the patient's condition. Therefore, the patient's condition does not match the target condition of the trial.
Eligibility Explanation: Since the patient's condition does not match the target condition of the trial, he is completely ineligible for participation. The trial is designed for patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which the patient does not have, as indicated by his symptoms and the absence of any related medical history or test results.
