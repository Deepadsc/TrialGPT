Patient ID: trec-20226
Patient Summary: A 61-year-old male patient presents with a nonproductive cough and progressive dyspnea. He has a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and peptic ulcer disease, and is a heavy smoker with a 30-year history of smoking two packs per day. Clinical examination reveals decreased breath sounds and percussive dullness at the base of the left lung. A CT scan indicates a left-sided pleural effusion and nodular pleural thickening. A thoracentesis yielded bloody pleural fluid, and a biopsy showed proliferation of epithelioid-type cells with very long microvilli, suggesting a malignant pleural condition.

Clinical trial ranking:
NCT04541160: matching_score=-0.8, agg_score=0.2, trial_score=-0.6, qrels_score=1
Brief Summary: This is a randomized study that sought to compare the rule-out capacity and antibiotics prescriptions associated with two different diagnostic imaging strategies (ultra-low-dose chest computed tomography versus chest radiography) in a group of healthy adults presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
Relevance Explanation: The patient presents with respiratory symptoms such as nonproductive cough and progressive dyspnea, which aligns with the clinical trial's focus on diagnosing community-acquired pneumonia using imaging techniques. However, the patient's definitive diagnosis of a pleural condition based on biopsy results suggests a different underlying pathology rather than pneumonia, reducing the overall relevance to the trial's primary objective.
Eligibility Explanation: The patient meets one of the inclusion criteria by presenting with a respiratory symptom (dyspnea). However, he does not meet other inclusion criteria such as symptoms related to infection or specific auscultatory findings (crackling rales), and he has a definitive diagnosis, which disqualifies him per one of the inclusion criteria. He does not meet any exclusion criteria explicitly, but the lack of information on some exclusion criteria (CURB-65 or PSA scores, BMI, ability to hold breath) prevents a full assessment of eligibility.

Brief Summary: COVID-19 pandemic has developed worldwide in less than 4 months. While most patients have a mild or uncomplicated disease (80%), approximately 15% need hospital care and 5% intensive care. Severe cases are characterized by pulmonary involvement which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Early identification of patients who are likely to get worse is therefore a major issue.~While, chest X-ray has poor diagnostic performances, pulmonary computed tomography (CT scan) seems very sensitive (97%) and quite specific of COVID-19. Sub-pleural bilateral ground-glass pattern can precede the positivity of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. CT scan is now considered as the best imaging test to assess COVID-19 patients and is recommended as first-line diagnosis tool by the French Society of Radiology (SFR). However, performing CT scan in all or many patients with suspected COVID-19 may result in radiology department overload, especially, taking into account bio-cleaning between patients. Moreover, CT scan may lead to adverse effects including induced cancer due to the cumulative diagnostic irradiation.~Chest ultrasonography may be an alternative to CT scan. It is a simple, non-invasive, non-irradiating, inexpensive and available at the point of care (POCUS). Most of emergency physicians and many other specialists (pneumologists, infectious disease or intensive care physicians) are trained to perform chest POCUS and use it in their everyday practice. Multiple studies have demonstrated its superiority to chest X-ray for the detection of pneumonia. In ARDS, a scoring has been developed and has shown good correlation with mortality. POCUS is very effective in detecting peripheral patterns and seems appropriate to explore COVID-19 patients.~Previous studies suggest its interest in SARSCov2 infections for initial patient assessment and identification of lung damage. However, its performances have never been scientifically evaluated to date.~Our main hypothesis is that point of care lung ultrasonography performed during the initial examination may identify high-risk COVID-19 patients.
Relevance Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation and medical history do not indicate COVID-19, which is the primary focus of the clinical trial. The trial aims to use ultrasonography to identify high-risk COVID-19 patients, but the patient has not been diagnosed with COVID-19 nor is there any indication of a positive RT-PCR test for COVID-19. Therefore, the patient's condition is not relevant to the trial's target conditions.
Eligibility Explanation: Since the patient's condition is not relevant to the clinical trial's target conditions, he does not meet the primary inclusion criterion of having a confirmed or probable COVID-19 diagnosis. Consequently, despite meeting age requirements and not being excluded by any exclusion criteria, the patient's overall eligibility is negatively impacted by the lack of relevance to the trial's focus.
