Patient ID: trec-202220
Patient Summary: A 49-year-old man presents with a bulging in his groin, diagnosed as a swelling above the inguinal ligament that increases in size upon coughing, indicative of a hernia. He has a history of mild dyslipidemia, which is well-managed through lifestyle modifications. He is scheduled for an elective laparoscopic hernia repair.

Clinical trial ranking:
NCT03566433: matching_score=1.0, agg_score=1.9, trial_score=2.9, qrels_score=2
Brief Summary: Immediate pain reaction and return to work after TEP or Lichtenstein hernia repair have not been studied. In this multicenter trial the patients are allocated to surgery using TEP (n=50) or Lichtenstein (n=50) technique. Pain and return to work are recorded postoperatively up to one month. Immediate and late complications are also analyzed.
Relevance Explanation: The patient is highly relevant to the clinical trial as he has been diagnosed with a symptomatic inguinal hernia, which is the specific condition targeted by the trial. His age of 49 falls within the trial's specified age range of 18-80 years. The trial aims to compare postoperative pain and recovery in patients undergoing either TEP or Lichtenstein hernioplasty for inguinal hernia repair, directly aligning with the patient's scheduled surgical treatment.
Eligibility Explanation: The patient meets the inclusion criterion of having a symptomatic inguinal hernia and being within the age range required by the trial. Additionally, he does not meet any of the exclusion criteria listed, such as having a large scrotal hernia, bilateral hernia, symptom-free hernia, inguinal pain without clinical evidence of hernia, or being classified as ASA class 3 or higher. Therefore, he is fully eligible for participation in the trial.

NCT04228536: matching_score=-2.0, agg_score=0.0, trial_score=-2.0, qrels_score=1
Brief Summary: The goal of this study was to evaluate chronic pain and reoperation rates due to recurrence after groin hernia surgery in women compared to men and surgical method.
Relevance Explanation: The patient is a 49-year-old man with a groin hernia, which aligns with the target conditions of the trial (inguinal hernia). However, the trial specifically focuses on women, making the patient's gender mismatch a critical factor in determining relevance. Despite the condition match, the gender-specific nature of the study significantly reduces the relevance of this trial for the patient.
Eligibility Explanation: The patient is ineligible for the clinical trial primarily due to the gender requirement. The trial specifically targets women, and the patient is a man. This gender mismatch directly excludes him from participation, as indicated by the criterion-level eligibility predictions.
