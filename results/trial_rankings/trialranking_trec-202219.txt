Patient ID: trec-202219
Patient Summary: A 7-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with a generalized rash and symptoms suggestive of an allergic reaction, possibly due to an insect sting while playing outdoors. She exhibits signs of anaphylaxis, including hypotension (blood pressure 75/55 mm Hg) and tachycardia (heart rate 122/min), along with erythematous, raised plaques on her trunk, extremities, and face. Additionally, she has bilateral expiratory wheezes indicating respiratory distress.

Brief Summary: Plague is a potentially fatal infection in humans caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. Pneumonic plague is typically diagnosed in humans with high mortality. It has a long history for plague as an agent of biowarfare, and poses a serious threat to international security. Althought the killed whole-cell plague vaccine and live attenuated vaccine have been licensed, they are rarely used today because of toxicities, limited evidence for efficacy to prevent plague, and limited commercial availability. In the last twenty years,the recombinant subunit vaccines comprised by fraction 1 capsule(F1)and virulence-associated (V)antigens as the main composition have caused widely attention with providing greater protection than vaccines comprised of either subunit alone. This study was aimed to explor the safety and immunogenicity of a new type plague subunit vaccine which comprised natural F1 antigen and recombined V antigen (F1+rV).
Relevance Explanation: The patient is a 7-year-old girl presenting with symptoms of an allergic reaction, which is not related to the plague or the vaccine being tested in the clinical trial. The trial specifically targets healthy adults aged 18-55 months for a plague vaccine, focusing on immunogenicity and safety. The patient's age and current health condition (allergic reaction) make her irrelevant to the trial's target demographic and objectives.
Eligibility Explanation: Since the patient's relevance score is 0, indicating complete irrelevance to the clinical trial, the eligibility score must also be 0. This is because the patient's age and health condition do not align with the trial's inclusion criteria, specifically targeting a different age group and health status.

NCT04648969: matching_score=-2.0, agg_score=0.0, trial_score=-2.0, qrels_score=1
Brief Summary: The goal of this study is to develop novel treatments for patients with a condition called hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) through the use of exogenous kisspeptin.
Relevance Explanation: The patient does not have hypogonadotropic hypogonadism or any related symptoms or diagnosis, which is the target condition of the clinical trial. The patient's symptoms and medical history described in the note are unrelated to the condition being studied in the trial.
Eligibility Explanation: Since the patient's condition is not relevant to the clinical trial, she does not meet any of the inclusion criteria. Additionally, she is explicitly excluded by the trial's age requirement and her abnormal blood pressure.
