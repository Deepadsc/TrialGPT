Patient ID: trec-202210
Patient Summary: A 19-year-old female presents with a four-month history of a non-tender, rounded, transilluminating mass on the dorsal aspect of her left wrist, primarily concerned about its cosmetic appearance. She is left-handed and requires extensive use of her hands for typing, which could be relevant to the wrist mass. Her vital signs are normal, and she does not have any reported history of smoking or illicit drug use. She is sexually active with two partners and uses condoms.

Clinical trial ranking:
NCT00335920: matching_score=-0.71429, agg_score=0.0, trial_score=-0.71429, qrels_score=1
Brief Summary: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an intratympanic continuous two-week application of dexamethasone compared to placebo using a temporarily implanted catheter in patients with severe to profound sudden sensorineural hearing loss and insufficient recovery after initial systemic prednisolone therapy.
Relevance Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation and concerns are centered around a wrist mass, which is unrelated to the clinical trial's focus on sudden sensorineural hearing loss. There is no mention of hearing loss or related symptoms in the patient's note, indicating that the trial's target condition does not align with the patient's current health issues.
Eligibility Explanation: Since the patient's condition (wrist mass) does not match the specific requirements of the clinical trial (sudden sensorineural hearing loss), she does not meet any of the inclusion criteria that are specific to the diagnosis and characteristics of hearing loss required by the trial. Therefore, she is completely ineligible for participation.

NCT04648969: matching_score=-2.0, agg_score=0.0, trial_score=-2.0, qrels_score=1
Brief Summary: The goal of this study is to develop novel treatments for patients with a condition called hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) through the use of exogenous kisspeptin.
Relevance Explanation: The patient presents with a wrist mass, which is unrelated to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), the target condition of the clinical trial. There is no mention of any symptoms or diagnostic findings that would suggest the patient has HH. Therefore, the patient's condition does not align with the focus of the trial.
Eligibility Explanation: Since the patient's condition (wrist mass) is not relevant to the trial's target condition (HH), she does not meet any of the inclusion criteria. Additionally, the patient is excluded by the age criterion as she is 19 and the trial excludes those 18 years and older. Therefore, she is completely ineligible for the trial.
