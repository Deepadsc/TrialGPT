Patient ID: trec-202214
Patient Summary: A 39-year-old man presents with severe pain, redness, and swelling in his left toe, specifically at the first metatarsophalangeal joint. He has a history of gouty arthritis, confirmed by the presence of needle-shaped crystals in the joint fluid and a high leukocyte count. There is no recent trauma or fever associated with this episode. His medical treatment includes Allopurinol for gout prevention. Family history is notable for gout in his father.

Brief Summary: Gout is secondary to urate crystal deposition after chronic elevation of serum urate level. Urate crystal deposition is responsible for acute and recurrent inflammatory flares which can be treated with colchicine, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), corticosteroid or interleukin (IL)-1b blockade. Colchicine and NSAID are contra-indicated in patients with chronic renal disease (CKD) stage 4/5 or with renal transplantation. In these patients gout flare is treated with high dose of corticosteroid or IL-1b inhibitors.~Frequent use of high dose of corticosteroid can worsen gout comorbidities including mellitus diabetes type 2, hypertension, obesity and dyslipidemia. Anakinra, an IL-1b receptor antagonist, is efficient in gout flare in patients without CKD stage 4/5.~The aim of this study is to demonstrate that anakinra is superior to prednisone to treat gout flare in patients with CKD 4/5 or renal transplantation.
Relevance Explanation: The patient is highly relevant to the clinical trial as he has a confirmed diagnosis of gout, which is a primary condition of interest in the trial. The trial specifically targets patients with gout flares and aims to compare treatments suitable for individuals with chronic kidney disease or renal transplantation, although there is no information confirming the patient has CKD or a renal transplant. The patient's acute gout flare and the confirmation of urate crystals in his joint fluid align closely with the trial's focus on gout management.
Eligibility Explanation: The patient meets several key inclusion criteria: he is an adult over 18, has confirmed gout, and his gout flare onset fits within the required timeframe. However, there is no information about the patient having chronic kidney disease or a renal transplant, which is a critical inclusion criterion for this trial. The patient does not meet any exclusion criteria based on the available information, such as participation in another trial, active infections, allergies to trial medications, or contraindications for the medications involved in the trial. Therefore, while the patient is highly relevant due to his gout diagnosis, the lack of information on his kidney health status slightly reduces his overall eligibility.

Brief Summary: Osteoarticular infections are painful and disabling diseases that require antimicrobial treatment adapted to the microorganisms implicated. Microbiological cultures are currently regarded as the reference for identification of pathogenic bacteria. However, the sensitivity of these cultures is very variable and depends both on the context in which clinical samples are taken, and on the pathogen involved. The rate of detection varies according to infection type: from 50 to 70% for infectious spondylodiscitis, 65 to 95% for prosthetic joint infections, 50% for gonococcal arthritis and 90% for non-gonococcal arthritis. The aim of the study is to evaluate the diagnostic performances of microbiological cultures and molecular methods in case of osteoarticular infections. The gold standard will be established by an expert group of osteoarticular infection (composed by a bacteriologist, a radiologist, a surgeon, an anatomy-pathologist and a rheumatologist), which established the final diagnosis of infected or not infected patients.
Relevance Explanation: The patient has gouty arthritis, which is not targeted by the clinical trial focused on osteoarticular infections such as spondylodiscitis, vertebral osteomyelitis, prosthetic joint infections, and septic arthritis. None of the patient's conditions or symptoms align with the specific infections studied in the trial.
Eligibility Explanation: Since the patient's condition (gouty arthritis) does not match any of the target conditions of the clinical trial (various osteoarticular infections), he does not meet any of the inclusion criteria specific to these conditions. Therefore, he is completely ineligible for this trial.
