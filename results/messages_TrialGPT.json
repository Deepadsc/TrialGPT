Anxiety itself can have a significant effect on the developing baby, on the newborn child and the mother-infant bonding process.

The benefits may extend after birth to mother-infant bonding, breastfeeding success and a reduced risk of postnatal depression. We will randomly select an equal number of women for testing and no testing (like tossing a coin, known as a randomized control trial) to be confident that any benefits observed are genuine.

The proposed clinical trial is a within-participant, double-blind, randomized, phase I controlled study evaluating the toxicology, biodistribution and potential activity of re-administration of rAAV9-DES-hGAA injected intramuscularly into the TA. Nine participants (18 to 50-years old) who reside within the United States with Late-Onset Pompe Disease (LOPD) will be included. The goal of the immune modulation strategy is to ablate B-cells (Rituximab and Sirolimus) prior to the initial exposure to the study agent in one leg and the subsequent exposure of the same vector to the contralateral leg after four months. At each study agent dosing, the contralateral leg will receive excipient. Patients will act as their own controls. Repeated measures, at baseline and during the following 3 months after each injection, will assess the safety, biochemical and functional impact of the vector.\nInclusion criteria:\n 0.

The proposed clinical trial is a within-participant, double-blind, randomized, phase I controlled study evaluating the toxicology, biodistribution and potential activity of re-administration of rAAV9-DES-hGAA injected intramuscularly into the TA. Nine participants (18 to 50-years old) who reside within the United States with Late-Onset Pompe Disease (LOPD) will be included. The goal of the immune modulation strategy is to ablate B-cells (Rituximab and Sirolimus) prior to the initial exposure to the study agent in one leg and the subsequent exposure of the same vector to the contralateral leg after four months. At each study agent dosing, the contralateral leg will receive excipient. Patients will act as their own controls. Repeated measures, at baseline and during the following 3 months after each injection, will assess the safety, biochemical and functional impact of the vector.\nExclusion criteria:\n 0.

While most patients have a mild or uncomplicated disease (80%), approximately 15% need hospital care and 5% intensive care. Severe cases are characterized by pulmonary involvement which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Early identification of patients who are likely to get worse is therefore a major issue.~While, chest X-ray has poor diagnostic performances, pulmonary computed tomography (CT scan) seems very sensitive (97%) and quite specific of COVID-19. Sub-pleural bilateral ground-glass pattern can precede the positivity of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. CT scan is now considered as the best imaging test to assess COVID-19 patients and is recommended as first-line diagnosis tool by the French Society of Radiology (SFR). However, performing CT scan in all or many patients with suspected COVID-19 may result in radiology department overload, especially, taking into account bio-cleaning between patients. Moreover, CT scan may lead to adverse effects including induced cancer due to the cumulative diagnostic irradiation.~Chest ultrasonography may be an alternative to CT scan. It is a simple, non-invasive, non-irradiating, inexpensive and available at the point of care (POCUS). Most of emergency physicians and many other specialists (pneumologists, infectious disease or intensive care physicians) are trained to perform chest POCUS and use it in their everyday practice. Multiple studies have demonstrated its superiority to chest X-ray for the detection of pneumonia. In ARDS, a scoring has been developed and has shown good correlation with mortality. POCUS is very effective in detecting peripheral patterns and seems appropriate to explore COVID-19 patients.~Previous studies suggest its interest in SARSCov2 infections for initial patient assessment and identification of lung damage.

Because of the premature closure, the skull is not able to grow in its natural shape; instead, it compensates with growth in areas of the skull where the sutures have not yet closed. This can result in an abnormally shaped head, wide-set eyes, and flattened cheekbones. Patients may also have an enlarged head, abnormalities of the hands or feet, and hearing loss.~The fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene, which is involved in the development and maintenance of bone tissue, plays a role in Muenke syndrome. In some cases, the FGFR3 mutation is inherited from a parent with Muenke syndrome; in other cases, where there is no family history of the disorder, the mutation occurs anew. A better understanding of this gene may lead researchers to develop better treatments and genetic counseling for people affected by Muenke syndrome.~Patients with Muenke syndrome and their blood relatives may be eligible for this study. Family members with confirmed Muenke syndrome will have genetic counseling, and patients undergo the following tests and procedures:~Review of medical records and test results.~Questionnaires about the patient's prenatal, birth, newborn, and past medical history; family history; growth and development; medications; and current therapies.~Physical, neurological, ear, nose and throat, dental, and eye examinations.~Neuropsychological testing to assess cognitive thinking abilities.~Hearing evaluation. This includes an audiology test in which the patients listens to soft tones through earphones; a power reflectance test in which a chirping sound is heard through an earpiece placed at the entrance to the ear canal, and possibly an ABR/ASSR test, in which electrodes are attached to the forehead, earlobes, and behind the ears to measure brain waves in response to certain conditions.~MRI scan of the brain. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed pictures of the brain. During the scan, the patient lies on a table in a narrow cylinder (the scanner), wearing ear plugs to muffle loud noises that occur with electrical switching of the magnetic fields.~MRI scan of the middle and inner ear. This test is similar to the MRI, but uses a dye injected in a vein to enhance the images.~CT scan of the skull. CT uses x-rays to produce 3-dimensional images of the part of the body studied.~Dental evaluation with x-rays.~Skeletal survey (x-rays of all bones of the body).~Developmental assessment of IQ testing.~Blood tests for research purposes.

Subjects who have had confirmation of a Pro250Arg mutation in FGFR3 by a CLIA-certified laboratory. Our research team must receive a photocopy of the positive test result in order to enroll a patient in the study. All races and genders are known to be at risk for Muenke syndrome. Nationality or place of origin is not a specific barrier to participation.\n1. Family members (typically parents or siblings) of probands with Muenke syndrome are also eligible to participate.\n2. Since the penetrance of Muenke syndrome is incomplete, any at risk individual will be given the option of enrolling in the research study for FGFR3 testing. Those individuals who are found to carry the p.Pro250Arg mutation may benefit from interventions like hearing screening or speech evaluations that would alter their medical management. Variable expressivity is another characteristic of Muenke syndrome and carrier status and adequate genetic counseling are important. Individuals with the mutation will be invited to participate in the clinical and/or medical record review arms of the study\n3. Unaffected family members of a proband enrolled in the clinical protocol may choose to provide a blood sample and/or participate in the behavioral arm of the study. These information will be used only for purposes of further research on Muenke syndrome.\n4. Patient of interest cases. Geneticists and genetic counselors may refer individuals who are suspected to have Muenke syndrome, but who have not yet been tested for the FGFR3 Pro250Arg mutation. The purpose of enrolling these subjects is to evaluate a wider spectrum of patients for the mutation causing Muenke syndrome. Testing for the Pro250Arg mutation maybe performed at the discretion of our research group. Those individuals who are found to carry the Pro250 Arg mutation may be invited to participate in the study.

It is our intention to remove as many economic, cultural, geographic, racial, and gender barriers as we reasonably can to promote participation of individuals with Muenke syndrome and their families for research purposes. The study will include pediatric and decisionally-impaired individuals, because these characteristics are possible with Muenke syndrome. Pregnant or nursing women may be limited in their participation in some aspects of the study.\n4. As described above, Muenke syndrome has been demonstrated to occur in persons of different ethnic backgrounds. We would make every reasonable effort to encourage the enrollment and participation of a wide spectrum of individuals.\n5. -Pregnant women will not be excluded.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the information and provide the JSON output as described above.\n",

A secondary objective is to determine if IL-10 demonstrates sufficient anti-inflammatory activity in the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis to warrant further study in a larger trial. In this study, IL-10 will be given either alone or in combination with standard therapeutic agents, usually consisting of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and/or prednisone. Patients will be eligible to receive IL-10 when there is evidence of active disease. IL-10 will be administered by subcutaneous injection at a dose of 4 \u00b5 (Micro)g/kg/day for 28 days.\nInclusion criteria:\n 0. Diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis based on clinical characteristics and histopathological and/or angiographic evidence of vasculitis or the presence of glomerulonephritis and a positive assay for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA).\n1. Age between 18 to 65 years.\n2. No change in immunosuppressive drug therapy during the prior 4 weeks and one of the following:\n3. Persistent disease activity (Vasculitis Activity Index score of greater than or equal to 3) despite optimal therapy;\n4.

In these patients gout flare is treated with high dose of corticosteroid or IL-1b inhibitors.~Frequent use of high dose of corticosteroid can worsen gout comorbidities including mellitus diabetes type 2, hypertension, obesity and dyslipidemia.

Microbiological cultures are currently regarded as the reference for identification of pathogenic bacteria. However, the sensitivity of these cultures is very variable and depends both on the context in which clinical samples are taken, and on the pathogen involved. The rate of detection varies according to infection type: from 50 to 70% for infectious spondylodiscitis, 65 to 95% for prosthetic joint infections, 50% for gonococcal arthritis and 90% for non-gonococcal arthritis. The aim of the study is to evaluate the diagnostic performances of microbiological cultures and molecular methods in case of osteoarticular infections. The gold standard will be established by an expert group of osteoarticular infection (composed by a bacteriologist, a radiologist, a surgeon, an anatomy-pathologist and a rheumatologist), which established the final diagnosis of infected or not infected patients.\nInclusion criteria:\n 0.

The proposed clinical trial is a within-participant, double-blind, randomized, phase I controlled study evaluating the toxicology, biodistribution and potential activity of re-administration of rAAV9-DES-hGAA injected intramuscularly into the TA. Nine participants (18 to 50-years old) who reside within the United States with Late-Onset Pompe Disease (LOPD) will be included. The goal of the immune modulation strategy is to ablate B-cells (Rituximab and Sirolimus) prior to the initial exposure to the study agent in one leg and the subsequent exposure of the same vector to the contralateral leg after four months. At each study agent dosing, the contralateral leg will receive excipient. Patients will act as their own controls. Repeated measures, at baseline and during the following 3 months after each injection, will assess the safety, biochemical and functional impact of the vector.\nInclusion criteria:\n 0.

The proposed clinical trial is a within-participant, double-blind, randomized, phase I controlled study evaluating the toxicology, biodistribution and potential activity of re-administration of rAAV9-DES-hGAA injected intramuscularly into the TA. Nine participants (18 to 50-years old) who reside within the United States with Late-Onset Pompe Disease (LOPD) will be included. The goal of the immune modulation strategy is to ablate B-cells (Rituximab and Sirolimus) prior to the initial exposure to the study agent in one leg and the subsequent exposure of the same vector to the contralateral leg after four months. At each study agent dosing, the contralateral leg will receive excipient. Patients will act as their own controls. Repeated measures, at baseline and during the following 3 months after each injection, will assess the safety, biochemical and functional impact of the vector.\nExclusion criteria:\n 0.

If no relevant information is found, return an empty list.\n3. **Eligibility Label**: Classify the patient's eligibility for the exclusion criterion using one of the following labels:\n\n   - \"not applicable\": The criterion is not relevant to the patient.\n   - \"not enough information\": The patient note lacks sufficient information to make a determination.\n   - \"excluded\": The patient meets the exclusion criterion and should be excluded from the trial.\n   - \"not excluded\": The patient does not meet the exclusion criterion.\n\n### Output Instructions:\n- **Provide ONLY a valid JSON object** with the following structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"criterion_number\": [\n    \"brief_reasoning\",\n    [sentence_id_1, sentence_id_2, ...],\n    \"eligibility_label\"\n  ],\n  \"criterion_number\": [\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n- **Do NOT include any text outside of the JSON object.** This means no explanations, headers, or footers outside the JSON.\n\n### Example Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"0\": [\n    \"The patient is...\",\n    [2],\n    \"included\"\n  ],\n  \"1\": [\n    \"The patient has...\",\n    [3, 5],\n    \"excluded\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n",
        "user_prompt": "\nHere is the patient note, with each sentence labeled by a sentence ID:\n<0.> A 49-year-old man comes to the office because of the bulging in his groin. <1.> Physical examination shows a swelling above the inguinal ligament. <2.> When the patient is asked to cough, the size of the bulge increases. <3.> His medical history is significant for mild dyslipidemia, which is under control by lifestyle modifications. <4.> He does not smoke, but drinks alcohol occasionally. <5.> His vital signs and other physical examinations are unremarkable. <6.> He is referred to a surgeon and scheduled to undergo elective laparoscopic hernia repair. <7.> The patient will provide informed consent, and will comply with the trial protocol without any practical issues.\n\nHere is the clinical trial exclusion criteria:\nTitle: Chronic Pain After Groin Hernia Surgery in Women\nTarget diseases: Hernia, Inguinal, Hernia, Femoral\nInterventions: Totally ExtraPeritoneal (TEP) repair, TransAbdominal PrePeritoneal (TAPP) repair, Open anterior mesh repair (OAM), Combined Anterior and Posterior technique (CAP), Open PrePeritoneal Mesh technique (OPPM), Sutured Repair\nSummary: The goal of this study was to evaluate chronic pain and reoperation rates due to recurrence after groin hernia surgery in women compared to men and surgical method.\nExclusion criteria:\n 0. Patients not responding to questionnaire. Patients were the first operation during inclusion period was a reoperation.\n1. Patient with bilateral operations during the study-period are only included once.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the information and provide the JSON output as described above.\n",
